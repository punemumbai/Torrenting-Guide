Part 1: Pirate Lingo (Jargons & Terms You Gotta Know)

Basic Terms

- Torrent: A file that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed.
    
- Magnet Link: A URL that enables you to download files via torrent clients directly without needing a separate .torrent file.
    
- Seeder: A user who has the complete file and is sharing it.
    
- Leecher: A user who is downloading the file (and maybe uploading too).
    
- Swarm: All the seeders and leechers connected to a torrent.
    
- Ratio: Your upload vs. download stats on private trackers. High ratio = good standing.
    
- Client: Software like qBittorrent that handles the downloading/uploading.
    
- Tracker: A server that helps find peers.
    

Other Helpful Stuff

- DHT (Distributed Hash Table): Peer discovery without a central tracker.
    
- P2P (Peer-to-Peer): Decentralized file sharing model.
    
- Private Tracker: Invite-only torrent site. Usually high-quality, fast speeds, and stricter rules.
    
- Public Tracker: Open to all. More leechers, more risk.
    

Part 2: Tools of the Trade

Torrent Clients (pick one)

qBittorrent (recommended and used by many): Lightweight, open-source, no ads. Others: Deluge, Transmission, Tixati

VPNs (must have)

Use a VPN. Period. No VPN = You're risking a copyright strike or worse. " 3rd World Country ? I will still recommend - why risk unnecessarily "

Antivirus & Anti-Malware

Don’t skip this. Torrenting brings risk. Recommended: Malwarebytes, Windows Defender (if updated), uBlock Origin (for blocking malicious popups)
